An animation effect of several section overlapping each other on scroll. The difference to genuine parallax effect is that here the sections actually overlap each other, fold in "a pile" on scrolling down and unfold one by one on scrolling backwards.

The example is based on gsap (Greensock) scrollTrigger plugin, but it shows how to apply it to a Next.js app, where all section have to preserve SSR.
